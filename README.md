Project: Recipes from The Odin Project

This project is intended to showcase the very basic HTML skills learned in the previous 
steps of The Odin Project's Foundations course. Primarily, it will show a working knowledge of
basic HTML structure and the ability to direct users around a webpage through relative and absolute hrefs. Additionally, it will use elements like &lt;em&gt; to bring attention to various parts of the webpage. All of this will be accomplished through the medium of a recipe website.

Once it is complete, it will be published to GitHub and accessible to all.
