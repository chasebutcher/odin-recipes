        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe will help you make your very own mindblowing hamburger for those special nights.
        While this recipe starts off simply by getting a nice sear on an 80/20 patty, it's what you do after that matters!
        Excellent spice selection and treatment of the hamburger bun will leave you and your guests
        wishing you had made a couple more.
