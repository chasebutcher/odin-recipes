    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Three russet potatoes (1/3lb each)</li>
        <li>Cold water to cover the potatoes two or three times</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil to shallow or deep fry</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice up all of the potatoes into desired fry shape. You can leave on or cut off the skin.</li>
        <li>Begin by soaking all of the potatoes in the cold water for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rinse them off and soak them again in a new bowl of cold water.</li>
        <li>The water should be clear -- if it is not, rinse and soak again.</li>
        <li>When the starch is fully removed (what was clouding the water), gently remove the potatoes</li>
        <li>Preheat a pan or pot to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Slowly add your cut up potatoes. Don't overcrowd the pan!</li>
        <li>When they're all finished, remove them and let them cool in a freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fry them again in the same oil. This is the last time!</li>
        <li>Remove them from the oil when golden brown and extremely crispy. Top with salt. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
